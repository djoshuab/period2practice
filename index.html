"Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has
roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over
2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney 
College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, 
consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of 
the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source."
